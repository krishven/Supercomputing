serialmerge.cilk
----------------

The shared-memory parallel merge sort algorithm (Par-Merge-Sort-SM) shown in Figure 1 which uses the standard serial Merge algorithm
for merging two sorted sequences. N has been set to 2^29 and M1 to 128. Can introduce a while() loop in cilk_main() to run for various N and M1.

parallelmerge.cilk
------------------

The shared-memory parallel merge sort algorithm (Par-Merge-Sort-PM) of Figure 2 which uses a parallel merge algorithm (Par-Merge). N has been set to 2^29, M2 to 1024 and M3 to 16. Can introduce a while() loop in cilk_main() to run for various N, M2 and M3.

Makefile
--------

Makefile for generating the executable file from the .cilk files. Set TARGET as parallelmerge or serialmerge depending as required.

job.sh
------

Specify proper job name, no.of required tasks, run time etc and executable file name and submit using 'sbatch job.sh'
